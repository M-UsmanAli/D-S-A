\section{Theory }              We have already studied array in our computer programming course. We would be using the knowledge we learned there to implement different operation on arrays.
Traversing Linear Arrays:-
Let A be the collection of data elements stored in the memory of the computer. Suppose we want to print the contents of each element of A or suppose we want to count the number of elements of A with a given property. This can be accomplished by traversing A that is by accessing and Processing each element of A exactly once.
The following algorithm traverses a linear array. The simplicity of the algorithm comes from the fact that LA is a linear structure. Other linear structures such as linked list can also be easily traversed. On the other hand the traversal of non-linear structures such as trees and graphs is considerably more complicated.
\section{Task}  
\subsection{Procedure: Task 1 }

\label{Figure:3}    
\end{figure*}
Write a C++ program to implement all the above described algorithms and display the following menu and ask the user for the desired operation.

\subsection{ }     

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
 
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int a[10],b=0,c;
	int d=0,co=0,n;
	loop:
	{
	cout<<"main menu"<<endl;
	cout<<"1: Enter element in the array \n";
	cout<<"2: for traverse the array \n";
	cin>>n;
	switch(n)
	{
		case'1':
			{
			cout<<"Enter the array less then 10: ";
			cin>>c;
			cout<<"Enetr the element in the array: "<<endl;
			while(b<c)
			{
				co++;
				cin>>a[b];
				b++;
			}
			}
		break;
		case'2':
			{
			cout<<"The traverse of array is: "<<endl;
			b=d;
			while(b<c)
			{
				cout<<a[b]<<" ";
				b++;
			}
			}
			break;
	}
}
		goto loop;
		return 0;
		
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Conclusion}  
In todays lab we have discussed how we  can create 1D and 2d array and how can we implement it on computer.
